# geoscience-unifr-py

Renkulab environment for the courses SGS.01101, SGG.02101, SGG.00272, SGG.00273,

## Introduction

This renkulab.io project contains the relevant coding course material for your course. Renkulab is an onion-like structure:

- Git (outer shell, saving and management)
    - JupyterLab (visual interface)
        - Jupyter Notebook (website-like programming environemnt)
            - Python (actual programming)

## Starting

All needed packages are pre-installed. You run this environment by looging into renkulab and then going to 
<font color=blue>Projects > geoscience-unifr-py > Environments > New (Select newest commit) > Start environment > Wait until "green" > Connect </font>.

Your web browser should show an URL like this:
- **https://renkulab.io/projects/<my-user-name>/geoscience-unifr-py**
    
    Where <my-user-name> is your renkulab.io user name.


The first start will take some minutes (you might see an error if you click the connect button too early; try again a minute later in that case).


## Working with the project

Each lesson has a separate folder. Inside these folders you will either find **2** Jupyter Notebooks, or place them there - after downloading them from moodle (work in progress).


## Saving (T-C-P)

To save your work, you need to <font color=red>use the git version control!!!</font>

You will always 
- **T**rack
- **C**ommit
- **P**ush

When you are done working, use the Git > Git Interface 
- Untracked (press "+")
- Give your save a name: In the field "Summary" type a description, e.g. "Lecture 3", or "24 March"; do NOT use dots "." !!!
- Commit (press "Commit"-button at the bottom - works only with a text in the summary)
- Push (press the small "cloud" icon with an "up-arrow" on the top of the Git window)

## Adding data

Data for the course is either already in the "data" folder or will be provided via moodle.
You can add the data to your project by "drag & drop".
