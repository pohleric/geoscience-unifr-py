# geoscience-unifr-py

Renkulab environment for the courses SGS.01101, SGG.02101, SGG.00272, SGG.00273,

## Introduction

This renkulab.io project contains the relevant coding course material for your course. Renkulab is an onion-like structure:

- Git (outer shell, saving and management)
    - JupyterLab (visual interface)
        - Jupyter Notebook (website-like programming environemnt)
            - Python (actual programming)

## Starting

All needed packages are pre-installed. You run this environment by looging into renkulab and then going to 
<font color=blue>Projects > geoscience-unifr-py > Environments > New (Select newest commit) > Start environment > Wait until "green" > Connect </font>.

Your web browser should show an URL like this:
- **https://renkulab.io/projects/"my-user-name"/geoscience-unifr-py**
    
    Where "my-user-name" is your renkulab.io user name (you can see it in the URL).


The first start will take some minutes (you might see an error if you click the connect button too early; try again a minute later in that case).


## Working with the project

Each lesson has a separate folder. Inside these folders you will either find **2** Jupyter Notebooks, or place them there - after downloading them from moodle (work in progress).


## Saving (T-C-P)

To save your work, you need to <font color=red>use the git version control!!!</font>

You will always 
- **T**rack
- **C**ommit
- **P**ush

When you are done working, use the Git > Git Interface 
- Untracked (press "+")
- Give your save a name: In the field "Summary" type a description, e.g. "Lecture 3", or "24 March"; do NOT use dots "." !!!
- Commit (press "Commit"-button at the bottom - works only with a text in the summary)
- Push (press the small "cloud" icon with an "up-arrow" on the top of the Git window)

## Adding data

Data for the course is either already in the "data" folder or will be provided via moodle.
You can add the data to your project by "drag & drop".
