    "\n",
    "The reason we are using Python is manyfold. 1) It is one of the most popular scientific programming languages. 2) The syntax (the programming *grammar*) is relatively clear and easy to understand. 3) Python is developped as open source and is free to download (open source = the code behind the language is open access; free = there is no fee you have to pay for using it). So you do not have to pay for licenses. You can install Python also on your own computer (Windows/Mac/Linux) - simply run a Google search on \"Install Python and Jupyter Notebooks on Windows/OSX\".\n",
